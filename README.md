***Problem Statement***

In the rapidly expanding real estate market, property prices vary significantly based on multiple factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms, furnishing status, and the time since posting. Buyers often find it difficult to estimate the fair price of a property, while sellers struggle to decide an optimal listing price that attracts potential buyers without undervaluing the property.

Manual estimation methods or simple price averages often fail to capture complex, nonlinear relationships between multiple property features. Hence, there is a need for a data-driven system that can accurately predict property prices based on real-time property attributes.


***Objectives***

To develop an intelligent predictive model that estimates real estate property prices using machine learning and artificial neural networks (ANN).

To preprocess and clean property data by handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and encoding categorical variables effectively.

To analyze the relationship between different property attributes (e.g., city, area, furnishing, BHK, property type) and their influence on price.

To apply feature scaling and model training techniques for better convergence and accuracy.

To evaluate the model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² to ensure practical reliability.

To visualize actual vs. predicted prices for understanding the prediction quality and identifying improvement areas.

***Why This Project***

Real estate pricing is influenced by multiple interdependent variables that humans cannot easily model without data analysis.

Using deep learning (ANN) enables capturing nonlinear patterns in data, resulting in more accurate predictions than simple regression or manual estimation.

The model can assist:

Buyers in making fair purchase decisions,

Sellers in setting competitive prices, and

Real estate companies in understanding pricing trends across different cities and property types.

***What This Project Does***

Reads and cleans a dataset of real estate properties (from sources like Kaggle).

Encodes and normalizes all numerical and categorical data.

Builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow/Keras to predict property prices.

Evaluates the model using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics to measure prediction accuracy.

Provides a comparison between actual and predicted property prices through data visualization.
